# SnakeGame

This is a simple implementation of the classic snake and fruit game in C++. The game is played on a square board, where a snake moves around and eats fruits while growing longer. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or its own body.

OOPs Concepts used
Class and Object: The Snake class is used to represent the snake in the game, and the Fruit class is used to represent the fruits that the snake eats.
Encapsulation: The member variables of the Snake and Fruit classes are declared as private, and their access is restricted through public member functions.
Inheritance: None of the classes are derived from a base class.
Polymorphism: None of the classes are used in a polymorphic way.
